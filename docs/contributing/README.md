## Essential Requirements for Contributing

Before submitting any contribution, you must follow these two critical requirements:

### 1. DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) Compliance

**Every commit must be signed** to certify agreement with the [Developer Certificate of Origin](gh-file:DCO).

#### How to Sign Your Commits

**Option A: Automatic sign-off (Recommended)**
```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

**Option B: Manual sign-off**
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message" -m "Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
```

#### IDE Integration

- **PyCharm**: Click `Show Commit Options` â†’ Enable `Sign-off commit`
- **VSCode**: Enable `Git: Always Sign Off` in settings (`git.alwaysSignOff`)

#### Verify Your Sign-off
```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h %s%n%b" -1
```

You should see:
```
[commit-hash] Your commit message

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### 2. Pre-commit Setup and Usage

vLLM uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure code quality and consistency.

#### Quick Setup

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks for this repository
pre-commit install

# Optional: Install commit-msg hooks for automatic DCO sign-off
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

#### Run Pre-commit

```bash
# Run on all files (recommended before pushing)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run on staged files only
pre-commit run
```

#### What Happens When Pre-commit Fails?

Pre-commit hooks may automatically fix your code. You'll see output like:
```
isort....................................................................Failed
- hook id: isort
- files were modified by this hook
Fixing vllm/your_file.py
```

**To resolve:**
```bash
# 1. Add the fixed files
git add <modified-files>

# 2. Amend your commit
git commit --amend --no-edit

# 3. Push (force push if you amended)
git push --force-with-lease
```

#### Common Pre-commit Hooks in vLLM

- **isort**: Sorts Python imports
- **yapf**: Formats Python code
- **ruff**: Lints Python code
- **typos**: Checks spelling
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **signoff-commit**: Ensures DCO compliance

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Title Format
Use one of these prefixes:
- `[Bugfix]` - Bug fixes
- `[Feature]` - New features
- `[Doc]` - Documentation
- `[Model]` - Model-related changes
- `[Core]` - Core engine changes
- `[Kernel]` - CUDA kernel changes
- `[Misc]` - Other changes

### Before Submitting
- [ ] All commits are signed (DCO compliant)
- [ ] Pre-commit passes: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- [ ] Tests pass: `pytest tests/`
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation is updated (if applicable)

## Quick Troubleshooting

**"pre-commit command not found"**
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

**"Missing DCO" error**
```bash
git commit --amend -s
git push --force-with-lease
```

**Pre-commit keeps failing**
- Read the error output carefully
- Let pre-commit fix your code, then add and commit the changes
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check everything
