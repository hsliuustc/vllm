## üîê DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) Compliance

### For All Team Members

- **Every commit must be signed**: Use `git commit -s` for all commits
- **Correct author information**: Each person should commit with their own email/name
- **No shared accounts**: Each team member should use their own GitHub account
- **Verify signing**: Always check that your commits include the Signed-off-by line

### For Final PR Submitter

- **Verify all commits are signed**: Check before submitting the final PR
- **Fix any unsigned commits**: Use `git commit --amend -s` if needed
- **Maintain commit history**: Don't squash commits from different authors
- **Check DCO status**: Ensure all commits pass DCO checks

### Example of Properly Signed Commit

```bash
git commit -s -m "[Feature] Add new attention mechanism" -m "This commit adds support for a new attention mechanism that improves performance for long sequences."
```

Result:
```
[Feature] Add new attention mechanism

This commit adds support for a new attention mechanism that improves performance for long sequences.

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

## üìã Commit Message Standards

### Format

```
[Category] Brief description (#issue_number)

Detailed description if needed

Signed-off-by: Author Name <email@example.com>
```

### Categories to Use

- `[Feature]` - New features
- `[Bugfix]` - Bug fixes  
- `[Core]` - Core engine changes
- `[Model]` - Model-specific changes
- `[Kernel]` - CUDA kernel changes
- `[Doc]` - Documentation
- `[Misc]` - Miscellaneous changes
- `[CI]` - CI/CD changes
- `[Test]` - Test changes
- `[Perf]` - Performance improvements
- `[Refactor]` - Code refactoring

### Examples

```bash
# Good commit message
git commit -s -m "[Feature] Add support for unquantized models" -m "This commit adds support for unquantized models in the EPLB framework."

# Good commit message with issue reference
git commit -s -m "[Bugfix] Fix memory leak in attention kernel (#1234)" -m "Resolves memory leak issue in the attention kernel implementation."

# Good commit message for multiple authors
git commit -s -m "[Core] Implement new caching mechanism" -m "Co-authored-by: Team Member <member@example.com>"
```

## üîÑ Branch Management Strategy

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Main branch**: Keep your fork's main in sync with upstream
2. **Feature branches**: Create separate branches for each feature
3. **Team branches**: Each team member works on their own feature branch
4. **Integration branch**: Merge all team changes into one branch before final PR

### Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/descriptive-name
bugfix/issue-description
team/feature-name
epic/major-feature
```

### Branch Management Commands

```bash
# Keep main branch updated
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-attention-mechanism

# Create team integration branch
git checkout -b team/eplb-integration

# Update feature branch with latest main
git checkout feature/new-attention-mechanism
git rebase main
```

## üß™ Code Quality & Testing

### Before Submitting PRs to Your Fork

- **Run tests**: `python -m pytest tests/`
- **Code formatting**: Use `black`, `isort`, `flake8`
- **Type checking**: Run `mypy` if applicable
- **Linting**: Check for any linting errors
- **Unit tests**: Ensure all unit tests pass
- **Integration tests**: Run integration tests if applicable

### For Final PR to vLLM

- **All tests pass**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- **No linting errors**: Clean code quality
- **Documentation updated**: Update relevant docs
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing APIs
- **Performance impact**: Consider and document performance implications

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_attention.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=vllm

# Format code
black vllm/
isort vllm/

# Lint code
flake8 vllm/
mypy vllm/
```

## üìù PR Process Coordination

### Team PRs to Your Fork

- **Clear descriptions**: Each PR should have detailed descriptions
- **Reference issues**: Link to relevant GitHub issues
- **Review process**: Review each team member's PR thoroughly
- **CI checks**: Ensure all CI checks pass
- **Test coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage

### Final PR to vLLM

- **Comprehensive description**: Include all changes and rationale
- **Test results**: Mention test coverage and results
- **Breaking changes**: Clearly document any breaking changes
- **Migration guide**: If needed, provide migration instructions
- **Performance benchmarks**: Include performance impact data

## üõ† Technical Considerations

### Git Configuration

```bash
# Each team member should set their identity
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# For signing commits
git config commit.gpgsign true  # If using GPG

# Set up aliases for common operations
git config alias.co checkout
git config alias.br branch
git config alias.ci commit
git config alias.st status
```

### Branch Protection

Set up branch protection rules on your fork:
- Require reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass
- Require up-to-date branches before merging
- Restrict force pushes

### Pre-commit Hooks

Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run pre-commit on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## üìû Communication & Coordination

### Team Communication

- **Regular sync-ups**: Coordinate on changes to avoid conflicts
- **Shared documentation**: Use shared docs for design decisions
- **Issue tracking**: Use GitHub issues for task management
- **Code review rotation**: Have different team members review each other's code
- **Slack/Discord channels**: Use dedicated channels for project communication

### Timeline Management

- **Milestone planning**: Set clear milestones and deadlines
- **Dependency management**: Coordinate on dependent changes
- **Integration testing**: Plan for integration testing phase
- **Release planning**: Coordinate release schedules

### Meeting Structure

- **Daily standups**: Quick status updates
- **Weekly reviews**: Code review and planning sessions
- **Sprint planning**: Plan upcoming work
- **Retrospectives**: Reflect on process improvements

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Squashing team commits**: Don't squash commits from different authors
2. **Missing DCO**: Always check for signed-off-by lines
3. **Incomplete testing**: Don't skip tests to save time
4. **Poor commit messages**: Use descriptive, standardized messages
5. **Breaking changes without notice**: Always document breaking changes
6. **Ignoring CI failures**: Fix all CI issues before merging
7. **Working on the same files simultaneously**: Coordinate to avoid conflicts
8. **Not communicating changes**: Keep team informed of major changes
9. **Skipping code reviews**: Always review each other's code
10. **Not updating documentation**: Keep docs in sync with code changes
